Welcome to the **HTTP Request Workshop** by [pekkakorpi-tassi.fi](https://pekkakorpi-tassi.fi)!

## Overview

The [http_request_workshop](https://github.com/p3kk4/http_request_workshop) repository is available on GitHub and serves as a material package that includes all the necessary resources required to learn about HTTP Requests via practical examples.

The material package can be used for self-paced learning, although it is primarily meant to be complemented by instructor-led workshops. During the workshops learners can engage in hands-on learning activities to increase their familiarity with HTTP Requests and surrounding key topics.

The learning environment for the workshops is meant to be learner-specific Jupyter Notebook (previously Python Notebook) that can be opened by local software or online services that allow working with this type of files. Jupyter Notebooks contain text sections written in Markdown syntax rendered as HTML and code sections that contain Python code than can be executed within Jupyter Notebook.

The major contents of the container-workshop repository are:

- [http_request_workshop.ipynb](https://github.com/p3kk4/http_request_workshop/tree/master/http_request_workshop.ipynb) helps learners to explore HTTP Requests and associated technologies by running Python code.

## Learning Environment Access

Learning environment enables learners to test HTTP Requests against live API over the Internet. For the purposes of this workshop we suggest using one of the two learning environment options:

- Open Jupyter Notebook of this work shop with Google Colab: [http_request_workshop.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/p3kk4/http_request_workshop/blob/master/http_request_workshop.ipynb)
  - You have to login with Google account to be able to execute Python code.
  - This is the **recommended** method of interacting with Jupyter Notebook.
- Open Jupyter Notebook of this work shop with Binder: [http_request_workshop.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/p3kk4/http_request_workshop/master)
  - There are yet unresolved errors in this environment with **ping** and **tracert** commands of [icmplib](https://pypi.org/project/icmplib/) library.
  - This is the **optional method** of interacting with Jupyter Notebook.
