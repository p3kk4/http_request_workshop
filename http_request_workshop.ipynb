        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP Request Workshop is available through pekkakorpi-tassi.fi website. The workshop consists of following key resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Main page of the workshop published on [pekkakorpi-tassi.fi](https://pekkakorpi-tassi.fi/materials/http_request_workshop.html) website.\n",
        "- REST API that allow learners to explore and learn about HTTP Requests.\n",
        "- Interactive Jupyter Notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/p3kk4/http_request_workshop) helps learners to explore HTTP Requests and associated technologies by running Python code that contains technical arrangements to test the REST API.\n",
        "- ***API documentation for the REST API that acts as a technology demonstrator and as a general example about API documentation.***\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file can be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) can be used for self-paced learning, although it is primarily meant to be complemented by instructor-led workshops. During the workshops learners can engage in hands-on learning activities and building their own documentation while exploring HTTP Requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## HTTP Protocol\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP acronym stands for Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol and it is the most important **top level** data exchange protocol of the Internet. HTTP works on Application Layer (Layer 7) of Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model. Important additional protocols related to HTTP protocol are Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and Domain Name System (DNS) protocol. Technically HTTP protocol works on TCP/IP Protocol stack (IP Protocol, TCP Protocol) that are part of the lower OSI reference model Layers. HTTP Protocol most often works through Uniform Resource Locators (URL), which everybody uses. As you type https://google.com to the address bar of the browser you are typing URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a collection of some relevant terms that you should be aware about related to the HTTP Protocol:\n",
        "\n",
        "- URL indicates human friendly name for a server application to be contacted.\n",
        "- Scheme (http:// or https://) indicates if connection is to be encrypted.\n",
        "- DNS name resolution is used to discover Public IP Address of the server.\n",
        "- HTTP Protocol is the message system client uses to exchange data with the server.\n",
        "- TCP Protocol + IP Address is what exchanges data between different networks.\n",
        "- Public IP Address indicates the network that the server is part of.\n",
        "- TCP Port (default 80 for http and default 443 for https) indicates application on the server.\n",
        "- Ethernet Protocol + MAC Address is what exchanges data within the same network.\n",
        "- MAC Address indicates unique network interface card.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop we want to explore HTTP Protocol specifically. Most people are actively (sometimes unknowingly) using a single HTTP method...:\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET\n",
        "\n",
        "...but at the same time they are also (frequently unknowingly) using 8 other HTTP methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- HEAD\n",
        "- OPTIONS\n",
        "- PUT\n",
        "- POST\n",
        "- DELETE\n",
        "- PATCH\n",
        "- CONNECT\n",
        "- TRACE\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning objective of this workshop is to make learners more aware about the HTTP protocol and how it works. This is an important ICT skill that helps people to understand the Internet and web services. Understanding many Pubic Cloud topics is superficial if learner has inadequate grasp on the OSI reference model and role of HTTP Protocol in it and relevance of HTTP Protocol to their lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding URL\n",
        "\n",
        "A good starting point to understand HTTP Protocol is to understand URL. It is URL that people and systems frequently use as they communicate between other systems over the Internet. You can check supportive diagram made available through [pekkakorpi-tassi.fi](https://pekkakorpi-tassi.fi/materials/understanding_url.html) website, but there is a wealth of material available on the Internet or through generative AIs to learn specifics about URL. Understanding how URL is structured helps you to associate each structural part to OSI Reference Model and how data transfer over the Internet happens."
